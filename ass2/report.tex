\paragraph This report provides a comprehensive overview of some of the most
popular models of the theory of learning styles, as well as a critical analysis
as to the suitability of such methods in a modern educational setting. A general
explanation of learning styles and their proposed benefits will be examined
along with the most relevant research papers for each model.

\paragraph Although much effort has been devoted by the scientific community to
ground learning styles in scientific rigor, this report finds that there is a
alarming lack of credible scientific results to correlate the claims put forth
by proponents of learning styles. Recommendations discussed include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{educational methods that have been rigorously shown to provide some of the benefits claimed of learning styles}
    \item{aspects of learning styles that have been shown to provide educational benefits}
    \item{todo$\dots$}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph While this report attempts to reach definitive, demonstrable
conclusions, it acknowledges the fact that the field of human learning is highly
complex and varied. It is impossible to provide a set of general recommendations
that will benefit everyone.

\section{Introduction} %% 1 page

\paragraph The theory of learning styles has been around in some form or another
for more than 40 years. Originated in the 1970's, the concept of learning styles
has had a widespread influence on modern education although the credibility of
the theory has come under serious question. This report will first cover the
most popular flavours of the learning styles such as Neil Fleming's
\textit{VARK} \cite{fleming2001teaching}, David Kolb's \textit{Experiential
Learning} \cite{kolb1984experiential}, and Peter Honey and Alan Mumford's
\textit{Learning Styles Questionnare} \cite{}. The core ideas of learning styles
will be critically examined, including the proposed benefits such as increaded
content retention, increased ability to understand new material, and enhanced
scores on testable material.

\paragraph After presenting the most prevalent models of learning styles, this
report will then go on to discuss the modern critique of the theory. Although
the theory has existed for a substantial period, there is an alarming lack of
scientifically rigorous studies to confirm the claims touted by proponents of
the theory. Though there have been attempts to ground the theory in factual,
reproducable experimentation, none have provided a satisfyingly conclusive
answer to the question of whether the application of learning style theories in
an educational setting has real, tangible benefit to the learning process. This
report will draw its own conclusions as to the suitability of learning styles as
an educational tool, and provide recommendations for any readers interested in
employing a model of learning styles in an educational setting.

\section{An Overview of Learning Styles}

\paragraph Although many distinct models of learning styles exist, they share a
core theme. Learning styles are broadly described as ``cognitive, affective,
and physiological traits that are relatively stable indicators of how learners
perceive, interact with, and respond to the learning environment''
\cite{keefe1990developing}. This suggests that an individual will be able to
learn at an increased rate, or with higher content retention, if they are taught
in a way that aligns with an innate personal preference for consuming
information.

\paragraph One well known model is Neil Fleming's \textit{Visual, Auditory,
Reading/Writing, Kinesthetic} or VARK model \cite{fleming2001teaching}.  Fleming
himself describes VARK as "a starting place for a conversation among teachers
and learners about learning" \cite{fleming2006learning}. The model claims visual
learners can learn best when consuming content visually, through pictures,
visual aids such as overhead slides, graphs, or diagrams. Auditory learners
benefit from listening to lectures, oral discussions, or tapes. Learners of the
reading/writing variety benefit most from committing their ideas to paper, note
taking, and reading material. Finally, kinesthetic learners prefer to learn via
physically doing, touching, and experimenting.

\paragraph One of the oldest models of learning styles, proposed in 1984, is
American educational theorist David Kolb's \textit{Experiential Learning}
\cite{kolb1984experiential}. This model outlines two related approaches for
\textit{grasping} experience: Concrete Observation and Abstract
Conceptualization as well as two other related approached for
\textit{transforming} experience: Reflective Observation and Active
Experimentation. The theory describes a cyclical model of learning, providing a
feedback look where "knowledge is created through the transformation of
experience" \cite{kolb1984experiential}.

    \includegraphics[width=5in]{figures_tables/kolb}
    \caption{The Experiential Learning model}
\end{figure}

\paragraph Using these four types of experiential learning, Kolb devised a
learning style inventory which can be used to identify four unique types of
learners.

\section{Critique of Learning Styles}

\paragraph Although the theory of learning styles claims to be able to provide
a more effective and efficient educational model, there has been a significant
lack of rigorous scientific research to support these claims. In order to
properly demonstrate the benefits of a learning style model, it is necessary to
first identify the individual learning style of a student according to the
model which is under scrutiny and then randomly assign them to any of the
learning methods included in the model. The student's performance on a variety
of tasks would then be thoroughly tested before and after instruction in
order to determine if the application of a particular learning style positively
impacted the student.

\section{Conclusions} %% at least 3 conclusions

\paragraph As discussed, the theory of learning styles has been largely
discredited and debunked. Although much effort and research has been directed
towards the theory, few are rigorous or conclusive enough to lend any real
credibility to the idea that the use of learning styles in a modern education
setting provides any kind of beneficial effect. The studies, while numerous,
fail to show any strong correlation between the usage of learning styles in an
educational setting, and improved content retention or higher grades on tests.
In many cases, these studies are plagued by confirmation bias. The researcher's
efforts to provide extra material to appeal to different learning styles only
manages to prove that additional content or instruction improves the learning
process, while the benifits cannot be directly attributed to the success of any
Learning Style based theories.

\paragraph While learning styles attempts to neatly characterize the infinitude
of possibilities for human learning into well-defined categories, the emerging
truth is that the learning process is much more subtle and complex. Attempting
to restrict learning to such clearly disjoint separations such as the VARK model
then becomes an exercise in failure.

\section{Recommendations} %% at least 2 recommendations

\paragraph The author advises any readers interested in the education process
and the psychology behind human learning to think critically about the theory of
learning styles Before blindly incorporating Learning Style related methodology
into a curriculum or educational program, consider the lack of credible results
regarding any possible benefits. It is possible that by restricting yourself to
one misguided model of education, you will limit your ability to efficiently and
effectively instruct. Instead, focus on some of the orthogonal results that have
come from research into learning styles. It has been conclusively proven that
providing a wide variety of educational resources, as well as stimulating,
engaging material contribute positively to material rentention.
