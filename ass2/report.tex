\paragraph This report, titled A Critical Analysis of Learning Styles, provides
a comprehensive overview of some of the most popular models of the theory of
learning styles, as well as a critical analysis as to the suitability of such
methods in a modern educational setting. A general explanation of learning
styles and their proposed benefits will be examined along with the most relevant
research papers for each model.

\paragraph Although much effort has been devoted by the scientific community to
ground learning styles in scientific rigor, this report finds that there is a
alarming lack of credible scientific results to correlate the claims put forth
by proponents of learning styles. Recommendations discussed include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{PD2 is a buncha junk}
    \item{S.W.E.D 420 blaze it}
    \item{do this shiz l8r $\dots$}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph While this report attempts to reach definitive, demonstrable
conclusions, it acknowledges the fact that the field of human learning is highly
complex and varied. It is impossible to provide a set of general recommendations
that will benefit everyone.

\paragraph First recognized in the 1970's, the concept of learning styles has
had a widespread influence on modern education theory ever since, although
recently the credibility of the theory has come under serious question. This
report will first cover the most popular flavours of the learning styles such as
Neil Fleming's VARK \cite{fleming2001teaching}, David Kolb's Experiential
Learning \cite{kolb1984experiential}, and Peter Honey and Alan Mumford's
Learning Styles Questionnare \cite{}. The core ideas of learning styles will be
explored, including the proposed benefits such as increased content retention,
increased ability to understand new material, and enhanced scores on testable
material.

\paragraph After discussing the most prevalent models of learning styles, this
report will then present the modern critique of the theory. Although learning
styles have existed for a substantial period of time, there is an alarming lack
of scientifically rigorous studies to confirm the claims touted by proponents of
the theory. Though there have been attempts to ground the theory in factual,
reproducable experimentation, none have provided a satisfyingly conclusive
answer to the question of whether the application of learning style based theory
in an educational setting provides measurable benefit to the learning process.
This report will draw its own conclusions as to the suitability of learning
styles as an educational tool, and provide recommendations for any readers
interested in employing a model of learning styles in an educational setting.

\chapter*{An Overview of Learning Styles}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{An Overview of Learning Styles}
\setcounter{chapter}{2}

\paragraph Although many distinct models of learning styles exist, they share a
core theme. Learning styles are broadly described as ``cognitive, affective,
and physiological traits that are relatively stable indicators of how learners
perceive, interact with, and respond to the learning environment''
\cite{keefe1990developing}. This suggests that an individual will be able to
learn at an increased rate, or with higher content retention, if they are taught
in a way that aligns with an innate personal preference for consuming
information.

\section {VARK Model}

\paragraph One well known model is Neil Fleming's \textit{Visual, Auditory,
Reading/Writing, Kinesthetic} or VARK model \cite{fleming2001teaching}.  Fleming
himself describes VARK as "a starting place for a conversation among teachers
and learners about learning" \cite{fleming2006learning}. VARK attempts to
classify an individual learner into the sensory category from which they benefit
the most.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=5in]{figures_tables/vark}
    \caption{The VARK model}
\end{figure}

\paragraph The model claims visual learners can learn best when consuming
content visually, through pictures, visual aids such as overhead slides,
blackboard visuals graphs, or diagrams. Auditory learners benefit from listening
to lectures, oral discussions, or tapes. Learners of the reading/writing variety
benefit most from committing their ideas to paper, note taking, and relevant
reading material.  Finally, kinesthetic learners prefer to learn via physically
doing, touching, and experimenting. Although it is possible for a learner to be
competent using more than one learning style, Fleming claims that information
can be consumed most efficiently when the dominant learning style of a student
is thoroughly utilized.

\section{Experiential Learning Model}

\paragraph One of the oldest models of learning styles, proposed in 1984, is
American educational theorist David Kolb's Experiential Learning
\cite{kolb1984experiential}. This model outlines two related approaches for
\textit{grasping} experience: Concrete Observation and Abstract
Conceptualization, as well as two other related approaches for
\textit{transforming} experience: Reflective Observation and Active
Experimentation. The theory describes a cyclical model of learning that provides
a feedback loop where "knowledge is created through the transformation of
experience" \cite{kolb1984experiential}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=5in]{figures_tables/kolb}
    \caption{The Experiential Learning model}
\end{figure}

\paragraph Using these four types of experiential learning, Kolb devised a
learning style inventory which can be used to identify four unique methods of
learning based on which experiential approaches are dominant.

Each style of learning represents a choice. In practice, it is
impossible to simultaneously play an instrument (Concrete Experience) and read a
instructional book on guitar playing (Abstract Conceptualization). Thus it is
necessary to resolve the conflict by making a choice between the two methods. As
one begins developing a preference as to which method of learning one is best
suited, this accumulated characteristic becomes what is known as an experiential
learning style.

\section{Honey and Mumford Model}

\paragraph The Honey and Mumford model of learning styles is based in part on
Kolb's experiential learning model, with some changes made to accord with the
managerial experiences of decision making and problem solving.

\chapter*{Critique of Learning Styles}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Critique of Learning Styles}
\setcounter{chapter}{3}

\paragraph Although the theory of learning styles claims to be able to provide a
more effective and efficient educational model, there has been a significant
lack of rigorous scientific research to support these claims. In order to
properly demonstrate the benefits of a learning style model, it is necessary to
first identify the individual learning style of a student according to the model
which is under scrutiny and then randomly assign them to any of the learning
methods included in the model. The student's performance on a variety of tasks
would then be thoroughly tested before and after instruction in order to
determine if the application of a particular learning style positively impacted
the student.

\chapter*{Conclusions and Recommendations}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Conclusions and Recommendations}
\setcounter{chapter}{4}
\setcounter{section}{0}

\section{Conclusions} %% at least 3 conclusions

\paragraph As discussed, the theory of learning styles has been largely
discredited and debunked. Although much effort and research has been directed
towards the theory, few are rigorous or conclusive enough to lend any real
credibility to the idea that the use of learning styles in a modern education
setting provides any kind of beneficial effect. The studies, while numerous,
fail to show any strong correlation between the usage of learning styles in an
educational setting, and improved content retention or higher grades on tests.
In many cases, these studies are plagued by confirmation bias. The researcher's
efforts to provide extra material to appeal to different learning styles only
manages to prove that additional content or instruction improves the learning
process, while the benifits cannot be directly attributed to the success of any
learning style based theories.

\paragraph While learning styles attempts to neatly characterize the infinitude
of possibilities for human learning into well-defined categories, the emerging
truth is that the learning process is much more subtle and complex. Attempting
to restrict learning to such clearly disjoint separations such as the VARK model
then becomes an exercise in failure.

\section{Recommendations} %% at least 2 recommendations

\paragraph The author advises any readers interested in the education process
and the psychology behind human learning to think critically about the theory of
learning styles Before blindly incorporating Learning Style related methodology
into a curriculum or educational program, consider the lack of credible results
regarding any possible benefits. It is possible that by restricting yourself to
one misguided model of education, you will limit your ability to efficiently and
effectively instruct. Instead, focus on some of the orthogonal results that have
come from research into learning styles. It has been conclusively proven that
providing a wide variety of educational resources, as well as stimulating,
engaging material contribute positively to material rentention.
