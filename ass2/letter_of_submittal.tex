\opening{Dear Mr. Champion}

This report, titled "A Critical Analysis of Learning Styles", was prepared
for my 2B Work Report for PD2: Critical Reflection and Report Writing. This is
my first work term report. My previous academic term was the Fall 2012 term. The
purpose of this report is to critically examine the claims put forth by the many
models of the theory of learning styles.

PD2 is designed to help students learn critical reflection and report writing.
The activities of the course guide students through the process of writing a
formal report. Through the completion of the course assignments and the creation
of this report, I have learned how to complete a report following the provided
guidelines. I have also had the opportunity to reflect on my unique learning
style and consider methods with which I can improve my ability to learn new
material.

This report was written entirely by me and has not received any previous
academic credit at this or any other institution. I would like to thank Ms.
Rachel Bruch for proofreading my report. I received no other assistance.

\closing{Regards,}
\end{letter}
