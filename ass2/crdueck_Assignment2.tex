    As discussed, the theory of Learning Styles has been largely discredited and debunked.
    Although much effort and research has been directed towards the theory, few are rigorous or conclusive enough to lend any real credibility to the idea that the use of Learning Styles in a modern education setting provides any kind of beneficial effect.
    The overwhelming response to Learning Styles in this modern age is that while individuals certainly have preferences, strengths and weaknesses associated with learning, there is a lack of hard scientific results to support the types of claims propenents of Learning Styles extoll.
